# CD-Junior-Lab-Project-4
System made to sample, store, digitally recreate, and analyze waveforms.  Signals are sampled using an ADC, stored in RAM, and sent via UART to software that plots the data and performs analyses.
This code is the hardware component of the project.  The software that analyzes the data was written by another group member.
Written using Vivado Design Suite in VHDL.
